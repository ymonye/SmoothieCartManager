# Test Plan

**Author**: Team 30

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

This is the Test Plan for the SmoothieCart application which is designed to run on Android devices. The application will be tested by the entire team but primarily the QA lead and the developer lead. The testing is composed of 4 categories : unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and regression-testing, these tests will not only test the Use Case Models defined but also the overall working of the application. The external systems will not be tested however the integration testing will test overall communication between the application and these systems.

### 1.2 Test Selection


| Test Method   | Scope              | Technique |Testers|
| ------------ | -------------------| ---------------| --------|
| Unit | Multiple tests per class  | White Box  | QA Lead |
| Integration    |  Between 2 or more classes      | White and Black Box  |QA Lead |
| System    | Completed App on different systems   | Black Box             | TEAM |
| Regression    |  Selection of the tests above  | White and Black Box  | TEAM |

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The objective is to test the functionality of the system. All of the requirements and Use cases will be tested by their designated unit tests and system tests, it is considered adequate if both set of test methods pass for each requirement.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

The QA Lead will document and maintain a spreadsheet called SmoothieCart_Issues that lists the issues found. The QA Lead will work closely with the Developer lead to address them.

The spreadsheet will have the following Categories:

**Description** - Provides description of the request.

**Bug/ER** - Identifies whether it's a bug or Enhancement request.

**Date found** - Date the issue was found.

**Severity** -  States the severity of the fix needed to prioritize the coding work, the severities are either Critical, Major, and Minor. Critical fixes will be addressed first.

**Date fixed** - Addresses whether the issue is fixed or not and lists the date that it is fixed on.


### 1.5 Technology

The App will be tested primarily with Unit and Manual testing.
