# Project Plan 

**Author**: Team 30

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to design and develop an Android app to manage a payment and rewards management system for Smoothie Carts.


## 2 Process Description

### 2.1 Software Design

**Start Date:** 10/3/2015

**End Date:** 10/9/2015

During this phase, system requirements are gathered and a high level design is created based on the system requirements and proposed software designs.

**Entrance Criteria:** System requirements and proposed software designs 

**Exit Criteria:** An analysis of the pros and cons of the previously submitted software designs (design-discussion.md), as well as a new team software design (design-team.pdf)

### 2.2 Inception and Elaboration

**Start Date:** 10/10/2015

**End Date:** 10/16/2015

During this phase we will determine the project's scope, illustrate the primary use cases that will drive the design, and prepare the supporting environment for the project.  We will also refine requirements and provide a preliminary test plan.

**Entrance Criteria:** Requirements gathered and initial design created

**Exit Criteria:** Stakeholder concurrence on project scope, understanding of requirements via the primary use cases, schedule estimates and development process determined.  Agreement that the vision and architecture of the product are stable. The following artifacts will be generated during the inception and elaboration phase:

- Project plan (ProjectPlan.md)
- Vision document (VisionDocument.md)
- Use-case model (UseCaseModel.md)
- Supplementary requirements (SupplementaryRequirements.md)
- Design document (DesignDocument.md)
- Test plan without results (TestPlan.md)

### 2.3 Construction

During this phase the main focus will be on building the software system.  We will complete the design, development and testing of all required functionality.  An alpha release of the system will be released, along with the user documentation.

**Start Date:** 10/17/2015

**End Date:** 10/30/2015

**Entrance Criteria:** Design plan, project plan, refined requirements and vision. Customer finalized Android utility software that provides credit-card scanning, payment processing, and email management capabilities

**Exit Criteria:** 
- Possibly revise earlier documents based on better understanding of the system
- Traceability information for a couple of use cases (Traceability.md)
- Alpha release of application
- Test plan with (possibly partial results)
- User manual (UserManual.md)

### 2.4 Transition

During this phase, we will validate the system with users (beta testing) and train users on how to use the system.  Based on user feedback, bugs will be fixed and a final version of the product will be released.  Documents will be revised if needed.

**Start Date:** 10/31/2015

**End Date:** 11/13/2015

**Entrance Criteria:** Initial product testing, system alpha release, acceptance criteria test development

**Exit Criteria:** Completion of the development cycle

- Possibly revised earlier documents (finish support material)
- Final version of Android app
